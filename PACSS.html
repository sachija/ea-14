       <li>CSS describes how HTML element are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in the other media.</li><br>
       <li><del><b>Css is not ncessary</b></del><span class="five">
       <b> CSS saves a lot of work.</b></span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br>
       <li><u class="two">Exernal stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</u></li>
    </ol><br>

   <h2 class="three">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2> 

   <ul>
       <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
       <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
       <li>External - by using a link element to an external CSS file.</li>
       <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in the external CSS files. However, <span class="five"><b>in this tutorials we will use inline and internal CSS styles,</b></span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
   </ul><br>

   <p class="four">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements, ID, on the other hand applies a style to a unique element. ID is also special in that in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>

   <p class="four">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element on a web page. once an element has been targeted, a style or a set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>

   <p class="four">There is wide range of selectors available, Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
